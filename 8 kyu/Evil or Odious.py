# The number n is Evil if it has an even number of 1's in its binary representation.
# The first few Evil numbers: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20
# 
# The number n is Odious if it has an odd number of 1's in its binary representation.
# The first few Odious numbers: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19
# 
# You have to write a function that determine if a number is Evil of Odious, function should return "It's Evil!" in case of evil number and "It's Odious!" 
# in case of odious number.
# 
# good luck :)
