# -----------------------------------------------------------
# This function takes two numbers as parameters, the first number being the coefficient, and the second number being the exponent.
# 
# Your function should multiply the two numbers, and then subtract 1 from the exponent. Then, it has to print out an expression (like 28x^7). "^1" 
# should not be truncated when exponent = 2.
# 
# For example:
# 
# derive(7, 8)
# 
# In this case, the function should multiply 7 and 8, and then subtract 1 from 8. It should output "56x^7", the first number 56 being the product of the 
# two numbers, and the second number being the exponent minus 1.
# 
# derive(7, 8) --> this should output "56x^7" 
# derive(5, 9) --> this should output "45x^8"
# 
# Notes:
# 
# The output of this function should be a string
# The exponent will never be 1, and neither number will ever be 0
