# You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!
# 
# Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the 
# array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).
# 
# Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics
# 
# Simples!
