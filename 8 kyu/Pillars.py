# There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three 
# arguments:
# 
# number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
# distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
# width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
# Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

    else:
        return (num_pill - 1) * (dist * 100) + (num_pill - 2) * width
