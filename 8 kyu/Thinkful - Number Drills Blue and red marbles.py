# You and a friend have decided to play a game to drill your statistical intuitions. The game works like this:
# 
# You have a bunch of red and blue marbles. To start the game you grab a handful of marbles of each color and put them into the bag, keeping track of 
# how many of each color go in. You take turns reaching into the bag, guessing a color, and then pulling one marble out. You get a point if you guessed 
# correctly. The trick is you only have three seconds to make your guess, so you have to think quickly.
# 
# You've decided to write a function, guessBlue() to help automatically calculate whether you should guess "blue" or "red". The function should 
# take four arguments:
# 
# the number of blue marbles you put in the bag to start
# the number of red marbles you put in the bag to start
# the number of blue marbles pulled out so far (always lower than the starting number of blue marbles)
# the number of red marbles pulled out so far (always lower than the starting number of red marbles)
# 
# guessBlue() should return the probability of drawing a blue marble, expressed as a float. For example, guessBlue(5, 5, 2, 3) should return 
# 0.6.
# -----------------------------------------------------------

def guess_blue(blue_start, red_start, blue_pulled, red_pulled):
    red = red_start - red_pulled
    blue = blue_start - blue_pulled
    return blue / (red + blue)
