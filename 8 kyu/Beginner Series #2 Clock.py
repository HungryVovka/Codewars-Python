# Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.
# 
# Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.
# 
# Example:
# h = 0
# m = 1
# s = 1
# 
# result = 61000
# Input constraints:
# 
# 0 <= h <= 23
# 0 <= m <= 59
# 0 <= s <= 59
# -----------------------------------------------------------

def past(h, m, s):
    return (h * 60 * 60 * 1000)  + (m * 60 * 1000) + (s * 1000)
