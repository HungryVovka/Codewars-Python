# -----------------------------------------------------------
# The Collatz conjecture (also known as 3n+1 conjecture) is a conjecture that applying the following algorithm to any number we will always eventually reach one:
# 
# [This is writen in pseudocode]
# if(number is even) number = number / 2
# if(number is odd) number = 3*number + 1
# #Task
# 
# Your task is to make a function hotpo that takes a positive n as input and returns the number of times you need to perform this algorithm to get n = 1.
# 
# #Examples
# 
# hotpo(1) returns 0
# (1 is already 1)
# 
# hotpo(5) returns 5
# 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
# 
# hotpo(6) returns 8
# 6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
# 
# hotpo(23) returns 15
# 23 -> 70 -> 35 -> 106 -> 53 -> 160 -> 80 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
