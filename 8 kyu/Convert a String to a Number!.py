# 
# Description
# We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?
# 
# Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.
# 
# Examples
# "1234" --> 1234
# "605"  --> 605
# "1405" --> 1405
# "-7" --> -7
# -----------------------------------------------------------

def string_to_number(s):
    return(int(s))
