# Exclusive "or" (xor) Logical Operator
# 
# Overview
# In some scripting languages like PHP, there exists a logical operator (e.g. &&, ||, and, or, etc.) called the "Exclusive Or" (hence the name of this 
# Kata). The exclusive or evaluates two booleans. It then returns true if exactly one of the two expressions are true, false otherwise. For example:
# 
# false xor false == false // since both are false
# true xor false == true // exactly one of the two expressions are true
# false xor true == true // exactly one of the two expressions are true
# true xor true == false // Both are true.  "xor" only returns true if EXACTLY one of the two expressions evaluate to true.
# 
# Task
# Since we cannot define keywords in Javascript (well, at least I don't know how to do it), your task is to define a function xor(a, b) where a and b are 
# the two expressions to be evaluated. Your xor function should have the behaviour described above, returning true if exactly one of the two 
# expressions evaluate to true, false otherwise.

def xor(a,b):
    return a != b
