# Theoretical Material
# 
# You are given two vectors starting from the origin (x=0, y=0) with coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). Your task is to find out if these vectors are 
# collinear. Collinear vectors are vectors that lie on the same straight line. They can be directed in the same or opposite directions. One vector can be 
# obtained from another by multiplying it by a certain number. In terms of coordinates, vectors (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are collinear if (x1, y1) = (k*x2, 
# k*y2) , where k is any number acting as a coefficient.
# 
# For more information, check out this article on collinearity (https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/collinear-vectors/).
# 
# Problem Description
# Write the function collinearity(x1, y1, x2, y2), which returns a Boolean type depending on whether the vectors are collinear or not.
# 
# all coordinates are integers
# -1000 <= any coordinate <= 1000
# 
# Notes
# All vectors start from the origin (x=0, y=0).
# Be careful when handling cases where x1, x2, y1, or y2 are zero to avoid division by zero errors.
# A vector with coordinates (0, 0) is collinear to all vectors.
# 
# Examples
# (1,1,1,1) ➞ true
# (1,2,2,4) ➞ true
# (1,1,6,1) ➞ false
# (1,2,-1,-2) ➞ true
# (1,2,1,-2) ➞ false
# (4,0,11,0) ➞ true
# (0,1,6,0) ➞ false
# (4,4,0,4) ➞ false
# (0,0,0,0) ➞ true
# (0,0,1,0) ➞ true
# (5,7,0,0) ➞ true

def collinearity(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return x1 * y2 == x2 * y1

# or

collinearity = lambda x1, y1, x2, y2: x1 * y2 == x2 * y1
