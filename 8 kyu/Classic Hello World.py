# You are given a method called main, make it print the line Hello World!, (yes, that includes a new line character at the end) and don't return 
# anything
# 
# Note that for some languages, the function main is the entry point of the program.
# 
# Here's how it will be tested:
# 
# Solution.main("parameter1", "parameter2","parametern")
# 
# Hints:
# 
# Check your references
# Think about the scope of your method
# For prolog you can use write but there are better ways
# If you still don't get it probably you can define main as an attribute of the Solution class that accepts a single argument, and that only prints 
# "Hello World!" without any return.

class Solution:
    def main(self):
        print("Hello World!")
