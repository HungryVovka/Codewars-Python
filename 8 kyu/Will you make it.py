# You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest 
# pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left.
# 
# Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not.
# 
# Function should return true if it is possible and false if not.
