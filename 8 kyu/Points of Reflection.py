# "Point reflection" or "point symmetry" is a basic concept in geometry where a given point, P, at a given position relative to a mid-point, Q has a 
# corresponding point, P1, which is the same distance from Q but in the opposite direction.
# 
# Task
# Given two points P and Q, output the symmetric point of point P about Q. Each argument is a two-element array of integers representing the point's 
# X and Y coordinates. Output should be in the same format, giving the X and Y coordinates of point P1. You do not have to validate the input.
# 
# This kata was inspired by the Hackerrank challenge Find Point

def symmetric_point(p, q):
    return [q[0] * 2 - p[0], q[1] * 2 - p[1]]
