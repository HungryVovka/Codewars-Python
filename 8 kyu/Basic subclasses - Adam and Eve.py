# According to the creation myths of the Abrahamic religions, Adam and Eve were the first Humans to wander the Earth.
# 
# You have to do God's job. The creation method must return an array of length 2 containing objects (representing Adam and Eve). The first object in 
# the array should be an instance of the class Man. The second should be an instance of the class Woman. Both objects have to be subclasses of 
# Human. Your job is to implement the Human, Man and Woman classes.

def God():

class Human():
    True

class Man(Human):
    True

class Woman(Human):
