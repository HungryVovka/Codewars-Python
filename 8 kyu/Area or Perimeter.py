# You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.
# If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.
# 
# Example(Input1, Input2 --> Output):
# 
# 6, 10 --> 32
# 3, 3 --> 9
# 
# Note: for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its length and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.

def area_or_perimeter(l , w):
    if l == w:
        return l * w
    else:
        return 2*l + 2*w
