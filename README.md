# Codewars-Python
ATTENTION! Be careful when peeping my solutions if you haven't already solved these tasks. If you rewrite my code verbatim you may have a chance to get a ban on the platform for cheating (takes into account spaces, newlines, brackets and similar variable names).

My assignment solutions of Codewars tasks by using Python.
