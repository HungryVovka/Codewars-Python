# The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
# Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!
# 
# Here's the deal:
# 
# It must start with a hashtag (#).
# All words must have their first letter capitalized.
# If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
# If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.
# 
# Examples
# " Hello there thanks for trying my Kata"  =>  "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"
# "    Hello     World   "                  =>  "#HelloWorld"
# ""                                        =>  false
# -----------------------------------------------------------

def generate_hashtag(s):
    s = s.strip()
    if len(s) == 0 or not s:
        return False
    words = "".join(i.capitalize() for i in s.split())
    hashtag = f"#{words}"
    return hashtag if len(hashtag) <= 140 else False
