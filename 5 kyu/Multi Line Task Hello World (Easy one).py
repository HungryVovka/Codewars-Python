# You are provided with the following functions:
# 
# t = type
# k = lambda x: lambda _: x
# 
# Write a function f that returns the string Hello, world!.
# 
# The rules are:
# 
# The solution should not exceed 33 lines
# Every line should have at most 2 characters
# 
# Note: There is the same kata for this task on JS, but way harder than Python one, so it is the best option to create a separated kata with fair rank.
