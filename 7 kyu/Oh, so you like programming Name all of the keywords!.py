# Yup, fill the provided set with the keywords of your language.
# 
# The test provides the number of needed keywords, and the error messages contain hints if you need help.
# 
# Details:
# Keywords are the words put aside as instructions for the compiler. For example (use these to get started):
# 	if True nonlocal
# If your language has contextual keywords, you won't find them here. Only keywords that are always recognized are included.
# The example test case will only check your list length.
# The keywords should be strings.
