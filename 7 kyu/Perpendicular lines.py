# You are given an input (n) which represents the amount of lines you are given, your job is to figure out what is the maximum amount of perpendicular 
# bisectors you can make using these lines.
# 
# Note: A perpendicular bisector is one that forms a 90 degree angle
# 
# n will always be greater than or equal to 0

def perpendicular(n):
    return n**2 // 4
