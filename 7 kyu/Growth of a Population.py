# In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 
# new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 
# inhabitants?
# 
# At the end of the first year there will be: 
# 1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070 inhabitants
# 
# At the end of the 2nd year there will be: 
# 1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141 inhabitants (** number of inhabitants is an integer **)
# 
# At the end of the 3rd year there will be:
# 1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213
# 
# It will need 3 entire years.
# 
# More generally given parameters:
# 
# p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to surpass)
# 
# the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to p.
# 
# aug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)
# 
# Examples:
# nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15
# nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10
# 
# Note:
# Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent is 2 you have to convert it to 
# 0.02.
# -----------------------------------------------------------

def nb_year(p0, percent, aug, p):
    year = 0
    while p0 < p:
        p0 += int(p0 * percent * 0.01) + aug
        year += 1
    return year
