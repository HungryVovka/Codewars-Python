# Create a function that will trim a string (the first argument given) if it is longer than the requested maximum string length (the second argument 
# given). The result should also end with "..."
# 
# These dots at the end also add to the string length.
# 
# For example, trim("Creating kata is fun", 14) should return "Creating ka..."
# 
# If the string is smaller or equal than the maximum string length, then simply return the string with no trimming or dots required.
# 
# e.g. trim("Code Wars is pretty rad", 50) should return "Code Wars is pretty rad"
# 
# If the requested string length is smaller than or equal to 3 characters, then the length of the dots is not added to the string length.
# 
# e.g. trim("He", 1) should return "H...", because 1 <= 3
# 
# Requested maximum length will be greater than 0. Input string will not be empty.
