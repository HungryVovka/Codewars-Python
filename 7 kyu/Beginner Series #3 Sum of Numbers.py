# Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two 
# numbers are equal return a or b.
# 
# Note: a and b are not ordered!
# 
# Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)
# (1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
# (1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
# (0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
# (1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
# (-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
# (-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)
# -----------------------------------------------------------

def get_sum(a,b):
    maxnum = max(a, b)
    minnum = min(a, b)
    return (1 + maxnum - minnum) * (maxnum + minnum) / 2
