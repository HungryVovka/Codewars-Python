# Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.
# 
# For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 9^2 is 81 and 1^2 is 1. (81-1-1-81)
# 
# Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 7^2 is 49, 6^2 is 36, and 5^2 is 25. (49-36-25)
# 
# Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.
# 
# Happy Coding!
