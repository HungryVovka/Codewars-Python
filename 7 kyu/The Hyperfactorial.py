# Description
# In mathematics, and more specifically number theory, the hyperfactorial of a positive integer n is the product of the numbers 1^1, 2^2, ...,n^n:
# H(n) = 1^1 * 2^2 * 3^3 * ... * (n - 1)^(n - 1) * n^n
# H(n) = ÐŸ(i = 1)^n i^i
# 
# Check out this Wikipedia article for more detail
# 
# Your task
# Implement a function hyperfact(num) that takes a positive integer num and returns the hyperfactorial of it.
# 
# In order for your answer not to be too messy (hyperfactorial of 100 is 9015 digits long) give the answer modulo 1000000007.
# 
# Notes
# 1 <= n <= 300
# 
# 50 random tests

def hyperfact(num):
    modulo = int(1e9 + 7)
    answer = 1
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        answer *= i**i
    return answer % modulo
