# -----------------------------------------------------------
# The task
# You have to make a program capable of returning the sum of all the elements of a triangle with side of size n+1n+1n+1.
# 
# The problem
# Your solution has to support 0 <= nâ‰¤ <= 10^6 Brute-forcing will not work!
# 
# The definition
# A triangle element aij where i is the column and j is the row can be defined as aij = 2j + i + 1 where 0 <= j <= i <= n
# 
# Examples
# For n = 2:
# 
# 1  2  3      \
#    4  5       \__ 1+2+3+4+5+7 sums to: 22
#       7       /
# sum(2) = 22
# 
# For n = 3:
# 
# 1  2  3  4   \
#    4  5  6    \__ 1+2+3+4+4+5+6+7+8+10 sums to: 50
#       7  8    /
#         10   /
# sum(3) = 50
# 
# Hints
# Euler transform (Optional)
# Sums of powers

    n += 1
    r = 6
    return (n**2 * 3 + n**3 * (r - 2) - n * (r - 5)) // r
