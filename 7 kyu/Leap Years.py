# In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:
# 
# Years divisible by 4 are leap years,
# but years divisible by 100 are not leap years,
# but years divisible by 400 are leap years.
# 
# Tested years are in range 1600 ≤ year ≤ 4000.
# -----------------------------------------------------------

def is_leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            return year % 400 == 0
        else:
            return True
    return False
