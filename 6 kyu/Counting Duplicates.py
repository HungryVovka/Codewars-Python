# Count the number of Duplicates
# Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the 
# input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.
# 
# Example
# "abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
# "aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
# "aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)
# "indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times
# "Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' occurs seven times and 's' occurs twice
# "aA11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
# "ABBA" -> 2 # 'A' and 'B' each occur twice
