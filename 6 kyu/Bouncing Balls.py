# A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor above ground level, h, is known.
# 
# He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).
# 
# His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.
# 
# How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing)?
# 
# Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:
# Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0
# Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1
# Float parameter "window" must be less than h.
# 
# If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.
# 
# Note:
# The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly greater than the window parameter.
# 
# Examples:
# - h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3
# 
# - h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1 
# 
# (Condition 2) not fulfilled).

    while window < h * bounce:
        h *= bounce
